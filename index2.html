    <h1>NSW Wildfire Data Visualizations (2000-2020)</h1>
    <p>
        The dataset used in this analysis covers the history of wildfires and prescribed burns in New South Wales, Australia,
        from 2000 to 2020. These visualizations are intended to inform policymakers about historical fire trends, the areas
        affected, and the types of fires. This information is crucial for understanding risk areas, allocating resources, and
        preventing future wildfire incidents.
    </p>

    <div id="map" class="chart-container"></div>
    <p>
        This map visualizes the areas impacted by wildfires and prescribed burns across NSW from 2000 to 2020. It helps
        identify fire hotspots and guide preventive measures and policies for fire management.
    </p>

 

    <h2>Fire Counts by Year and Type</h2>
    <div id="barChart" class="chart-container"></div>
    <p>
        This stacked bar chart illustrates the annual count of fires categorized by type (Wildfire or Prescribed Burn). It shows trends in fire activity, 
        which helps policymakers determine whether prescribed burns effectively reduce wildfires. For example, in 2009, a high number of wildfires 
        were observed, which may have been influenced by a lower number of prescribed burns.<b> This suggests that prescribed burns can be a critical 
        tool in reducing the occurrence of severe wildfires.</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Top Ten Largest Bushfires by Area</h2>
    <div id="top_ten_fires" class="chart-container"></div>
    <p>
        The bar chart highlights the ten largest bushfires in terms of area burned. It provides insights into the severity of past wildfires,
        helping to understand the need for effective land management, resource allocation, and prevention measures.
    </p>

    <h2>Scatter Plot of Burn Area vs Year</h2>
    <div id="scatterPlot" class="chart-container"></div>
    <p>
        The scatter plot shows the relationship between the year and the burn area. Each point represents a wildfire or prescribed burn.
        This helps assess trends in fire size over time and highlights patterns that could be addressed through policy.
